You can manage APIs natively in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} whether they're associated with any Cloud Foundry runtime, a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action, or a growing list of integrated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services such as the {{site.data.keyword.appconserviceshort}} service. Managing your APIs allows you to control usage, increase adoption and track statistics.

## API Management documentation has moved
{: #legacy-doc-moved}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} now offers the {{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}} service in addition to the Legacy {{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}}. While the Legacy {{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}} uses Cloud Foundry spaces, the  {{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}} service uses IBM Access Management resources. You can continue using the Legacy {{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}} for APIs that require Cloud Foundry spaces. If you want to create APIs in IAM resources, you can provision an instance of the {{{site.data.keyword.apigw_short}} service.

Both types of gateway are documented at the following {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} docs address: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/api-gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/api-gateway).
